I'm excited to share a project I worked on a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze the performance of an e-commerce store. This dashboard provides valuable insights into sales, profits, and customer trends, helping businesses make data-driven decisions, the dashboard aims to:

1-Track Business Performance:
Summarize and visualize metrics such as total sales, profit, quantity sold, shipping cost, and order count to assess the store's overall performance.
2-Identify Trends and Patterns:
Analyze trends in sales and profitability over time, providing insights into seasonal performance and growth opportunities.
3-Optimize Product and Market Strategies:
Highlight the most profitable products, categories, and markets to guide inventory management, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.
4-Evaluate Operational Efficiency:
Assess the impact of shipping costs and modes on profitability, helping to identify cost-saving opportunities.
5-Facilitate Informed Decision-Making:
Allow users to filter data dynamically (e.g., by year or shipping mode) for targeted analysis, enabling better strategic planning and operational improvements.
By focusing on these objectives, the project aims to enhance business insights, improve profitability, and support the storeâ€™s long-term growth.
